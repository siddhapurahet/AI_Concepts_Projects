It integrates the main findings of the Sixth \\nAssessment Report (AR6) based on contributions from the three Working Groups1, and the three Special Reports2. The summary \\nfor Policymakers (SPM) is structured in three parts: SPM.A Current Status and Trends, SPM.B Future Climate Change, Risks, and \\nLong-Term Responses, and SPM.C Responses in the Near Term3. \\nThis report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse \\nforms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being \\nand sustainable development, and reflects the increasing diversity of actors involved in climate action. \\nBased on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of \\nconfidence using the IPCC calibrated language4. \\xa0\\n1 The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; AR6 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation \\nand Vulnerability; and AR6 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication \\nrespectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021.\\n2 The three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial \\nlevels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable \\ndevelopment, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land \\ndegradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in \\na Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and \\n15 May 2019.\\n3 In this report, the near term is defined as the period until 2040. The long term is defined as the period beyond 2040.\\n4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. The IPCC calibrated language uses five qualifiers to express a level of \\nconfidence: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms are used to indicate the \\nassessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, \\nabout as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%; and \\nextremely unlikely 0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other \\nAR6 Reports.'),\n",

Current Status and Trends\\nObserved Warming and its Causes\\nA.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally \\ncaused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 \\nin 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal \\nhistorical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and \\nland-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, \\nbetween and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence ). {2.1, Figure 2.1, \\nFigure 2.2}\\nA.1.1 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C 5 higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–1900 6, with larger increases \\nover land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C). Global surface temperature in the first two \\ndecades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature \\nhas increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years ( high confidence). \\n{2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.2  The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–20197 is 0.8°C to \\n1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. Over this period, it is likely that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed \\na warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C 8, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, \\nnatural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability \\nchanged it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.3 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions \\nfrom human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO2 \\nof which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high \\nconfidence). In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2 \\nmillion years (high confidence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per \\nbillion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.4 Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59 ± 6.6 GtCO2-eq9 in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) \\nhigher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990, with the largest share and growth in gross GHG emissions \\noccurring in CO2 from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) followed by methane, whereas the highest \\nrelative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. Average annual GHG emissions \\nduring 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade on record, while the rate of growth between 2010 and \\n2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-1). In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG \\n5 Ranges given throughout the SPM represent very likely ranges (5–95% range) unless otherwise stated.\\n6 The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] °C). Additionally, \\nmethodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the \\nArctic. These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase \\ndoes not represent additional physical warming since AR5.\\n7 The period distinction with A.1.1 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 \\nis 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C.\\n8 Contributions from emissions to the 2010–2019 warming relative to 1850–1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO 2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2]°C; \\nmethane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C. {2.1.1}\\n9 GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different greenhouse gases in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO2-\\nequivalents (CO2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to \\nthe AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and \\nassess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations \\nand uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {2.1.1}'),\n",

( high confidence) {2.1.1}\\nA.1.5 Historical contributions of CO 2  emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in \\nterms of contributions to CO 2 -FFI and net CO 2  emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO 2 -LULUCF). \\nIn 2019, around 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO 2 -eq per capita 11 (excluding \\nCO 2 -LULUCF) while 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO 2 -eq per capita; of the latter a substantial share lacks \\naccess to modern energy services. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have \\nmuch lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO 2 -eq and 4.6 tCO 2 -eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO 2 -eq), \\nexcluding CO 2 -LULUCF . The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global \\nconsumption-based household GHG emissions, while the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. ( high confidence) { 2.1.1, \\nFigure 2.2}\\nObserved Changes and Impacts\\nA.2 Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have \\noccurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate \\nextremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and \\nrelated losses and damages to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities \\nwho have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately \\naffected (high confidence). {2.1, Table 2.1, Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)\\nA.2.1  It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Global mean sea level increased by \\n0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr -1  between 1901 \\nand 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr -1  between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr -1  \\nbetween 2006 and 2018 ( high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at \\nleast 1971. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical \\ncyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has further strengthened since AR5. Human influence \\nhas likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s, including increases in the frequency of \\nconcurrent heatwaves and droughts ( high confidence).  {2.1.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3, Figure 3.4} ( Figure SPM.1)\\nA.2.2 Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Human and \\necosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high \\nvulnerability to climatic hazards. Increasing weather and climate extreme events have exposed millions of people \\nto acute food insecurity 12 and reduced water security, with the largest adverse impacts observed in many locations \\nand/or communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, Small Islands and the Arctic, and globally for \\nIndigenous Peoples, small-scale food producers and low-income households. Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality \\nfrom floods, droughts and storms was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low \\nvulnerability. ( high confidence)  {2.1.2, 4.4} ( Figure SPM.1)\\nA.2.3 Climate change has caused substantial damages, and increasingly irreversible losses, in terrestrial, freshwater, \\ncryospheric, and coastal and open ocean ecosystems ( high confidence). Hundreds of local losses of species have been \\ndriven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes  ( high confidence ) with mass mortality events recorded on \\nland and in the ocean ( very high confidence ). Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as \\nthe impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain ( medium \\nconfidence) and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw ( high confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} ( Figure SPM.1)\\n10 GHG emission levels are rounded to two significant digits; as a consequence, small differences in sums due to rounding may occur. {2.1.1}\\n11 Territorial emissions.\\n12 Acute food insecurity can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result \\nof shocks risking determinants of food security and nutrition, and is used to assess the need for humanitarian action. {2.1}'),\n",

There are widening disparities between the estimated costs \\nof adaptation and the finance allocated to adaptation  ( high confidence). Adaptation finance has come predominantly \\nfrom public sources, and a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to adaptation and an \\noverwhelming majority to mitigation  ( very high confidence ). Although global tracked climate finance has shown \\nan upward trend since AR5, current global financial flows for adaptation, including from public and private finance \\nsources, are insufficient and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries ( high \\nconfidence).  Adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages \\nand through impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation, \\nparticularly for developing and least developed countries ( medium confidence) . {2.3.2, 2.3.3}\\nBox SPM.1 The use of scenarios and modelled pathways in the AR6 Synthesis Report\\nModelled scenarios and pathways 19 are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and risks, and \\npossible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables \\nand mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission \\npathways, including those based on cost effective approaches contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, \\nand have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about \\nglobal equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions \\nunderlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures. 20 {Cross-Section Box.2}\\nWGI assessed the climate response to five illustrative scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) 21 that \\ncover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. High and \\nvery high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 22) have CO 2  emissions that roughly double from current levels \\nby 2100 and 2050, respectively. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO 2  emissions remaining around \\ncurrent levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have \\nCO 2  emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO 2  \\nemissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 23 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate \\nchanges, impacts and risks. In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 \\npathways were categorised based on their assessed global warming over the 21st century; categories range from pathways \\nthat limit warming to 1.5°C with more than 50% likelihood (noted >50% in this report) with no or limited overshoot (C1) to \\npathways that exceed 4°C (C8).  {Cross-Section Box.2} ( Box SPM.1, Table 1)\\nGlobal warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850–1900 are used to integrate the assessment of climate change and related \\nimpacts and risks since patterns of changes for many variables at a given GWL are common to all scenarios considered and \\nindependent of timing when that level is reached. { Cross-Section Box.2}\\n19 In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI \\nprimarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emission and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when \\nreferring to WGI and modelled emission and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.\\n20 Around half of all modelled global emission pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The \\nother half looks at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.\\n21 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the \\nscenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. {Cross-Section Box.2}\\n22 Very high emissions scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out. Warming levels >4°C may result from very high emissions scenarios, but can \\nalso occur from lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. {3.1.1}\\n23 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m -2) resulting from the \\nscenario in the year 2100. The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not \\nidentical, with differences in concentration trajectories.

Panel (b): Selected global risks for land and ocean ecosystems, illustrating general increase of risk with global warming levels with low \\nto no adaptation. Panel (c): Left - Global mean sea level change in centimetres, relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges \\nbefore 1992 and altimeters afterwards. The future changes to 2100 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based \\non emulation of CMIP , ice-sheet, and glacier models, and likely ranges are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0.

The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by \\nmean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). “No-to-moderate \\nresponse” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further significant action or new types of actions). “Maximum potential response” represent a combination of \\nresponses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and political barriers. \\n(In this context, ‘today’ refers to 2019.) The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability, coastal hazards, in-situ responses and planned relocation. \\nPlanned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlements. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, \\nmay or may not be considered to be adaptation.

Over the \\nnext 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2–3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2–6 m if limited to \\n2°C (low confidence). {3.1.3, Figure 3.4} (Box SPM.1)\\nB.3.2 The likelihood and impacts of abrupt and/or irreversible changes in the climate system, including changes triggered \\nwhen tipping points are reached, increase with further global warming (high confidence).

At sustained warming levels between 2°C and \\n3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia, \\ncausing several metres of sea level rise (limited evidence).

There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural systems at global warming \\nof 1.5°C, and with every increment of warming, losses and damages will increase. The development pathways taken by countries at all stages of economic \\ndevelopment impact GHG emissions and mitigation challenges and opportunities, which vary across countries and regions. Pathways and opportunities for \\naction are shaped by previous actions (or inactions and opportunities missed; dashed pathway) and enabling and constraining conditions (left panel), and \\ntake place in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps.

WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and \\ngeophysical) were used to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For \\npotential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and \\nlow. The right-hand side of Panel a provides an overview of selected mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Costs are net lifetime \\ndiscounted monetary costs of avoided GHG emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and \\ntime and in the longer term compared to 2030. The potential (horizontal axis) is the net GHG emission reduction (sum of reduced emissions and/or enhanced \\nsinks) broken down into cost categories (coloured bar segments) relative to an emission baseline consisting of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios \\nfrom the AR6 scenarios database. The potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not additive. Health system mitigation options are included \\nmostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching \\nto electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. Gradual colour transitions indicate uncertain breakdown into cost categories due to uncertainty or heavy \\ncontext dependency. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options \\nfor 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the \\nsectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. \\nThe green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest \\nand the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use \\npatterns enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use \\nsectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional \\nenergy and resources. The last row shows how demand-side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows \\nthe projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, \\nthis projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural \\nfactors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow).  {Figure 4.4} \\nMitigation and Adaptation Options across Systems \\nC.3\\t Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve \\ndeep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. \\nThese system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and \\nadaptation options.

Large contributions \\nto emissions reductions with costs less than USD 20 tCO 2-eq-1 come from solar and wind energy, energy efficiency \\nimprovements, and methane emissions reductions (coal mining, oil and gas, waste) ( medium confidence).

(high confidence) {4.4, 4.5}\\nC.5.1 Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts in differentiation between states \\nover time and challenges in assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive \\nchanges in economic structure, with significant distributional consequences, within and between countries. Distributional \\nconsequences within and between countries include shifting of income and employment during the transition from \\nhigh- to low-emissions activities. ( high confidence)  {4.4}\\nC.5.2 Adaptation and mitigation actions that prioritise equity, social justice, climate justice, rights-based approaches, and \\ninclusivity, lead to more sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate \\nresilient development. Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable, social \\nsafety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-\\noffs with sustainable development goals. Attention to equity and broad and meaningful participation of all relevant \\nactors in decision making at all scales can build social trust which builds on equitable sharing of benefits and burdens \\nof mitigation that deepen and widen support for transformative changes.  ( high confidence)  {4.4}\\nC.5.3 Regions and people (3.3 to 3.6 billion in number) with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to \\nclimatic hazards (see A.2.2). Adaptation outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries and regions are \\nenhanced through approaches focusing on equity, inclusivity and rights-based approaches. Vulnerability is exacerbated \\nby inequity and marginalisation linked to e.g., gender, ethnicity, low incomes, informal settlements, disability, age, \\nand historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local \\ncommunities. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works \\nprograms, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services \\nand infrastructure. The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising access to finance to \\nreduce climate risk for low-income and marginalised communities including people living in informal settlements.

Many options are available for reducing emission-intensive consumption while improving \\nsocietal well-being. Socio-cultural options, behaviour and lifestyle changes supported by policies, infrastructure, and \\ntechnology can help end-users shift to low-emissions-intensive consumption, with multiple co-benefits.  A substantial \\nshare of the population in low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services. Technology development, \\ntransfer, capacity building and financing can support developing countries / regions leapfrogging or transitioning to \\nlow-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-benefits.

Clear goals, coordination across multiple policy domains, and \\ninclusive governance processes facilitate effective climate action. Regulatory and economic \\ninstruments can support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience if scaled up and \\napplied widely. Climate resilient development benefits from drawing on diverse knowledge. \\n(high confidence) {2.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7}\\nC.6.1 Effective climate governance enables mitigation and adaptation. Effective governance provides overall direction on \\nsetting targets and priorities and mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national \\ncircumstances and in the context of international cooperation. It enhances monitoring and evaluation and regulatory \\ncertainty, prioritising inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, and improves access to finance and \\ntechnology (see C.7). (high confidence) {2.2.2, 4.7}\\nC.6.2 Effective local, municipal, national and subnational institutions build consensus for climate action among diverse \\ninterests, enable coordination and inform strategy setting but require adequate institutional capacity. Policy support is \\ninfluenced by actors in civil society, including businesses, youth, women, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local \\ncommunities. Effectiveness is enhanced by political commitment and partnerships between different groups in society. \\n(high confidence) {2.2, 4.7}\\nC.6.3 Effective multilevel governence for mitigation, adaptation, risk management, and climate resilient development is \\nenabled by inclusive decision processes that prioritise equity and justice in planning and implementation, allocation of \\nappropriate resources, institutional review, and monitoring and evaluation. Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often \\nreduced through carefully designed and implemented laws, policies, participatory processes, and interventions that \\naddress context specific inequities such as those based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income. (high \\nconfidence) {4.4, 4.7}\\nC.6.4  Regulatory and economic instruments could support deep emissions reductions if scaled up and applied more widely \\n(high confidence). Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments can improve mitigation outcomes in \\nsectoral applications, consistent with national circumstances ( high confidence). Where implemented, carbon pricing \\ninstruments have incentivized low-cost emissions reduction measures but have been less effective, on their own and \\nat prevailing prices during the assessment period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary for further reductions \\n(medium confidence ). Equity and distributional impacts of such carbon pricing instruments, e.g., carbon taxes and \\nemissions trading, can be addressed by using revenue to support low-income households, among other approaches. \\nRemoving fossil fuel subsidies would reduce emissions 54 and yield benefits such as improved public revenue, \\nmacroeconomic and sustainability performance; subsidy removal can have adverse distributional impacts, especially \\non the most economically vulnerable groups which, in some cases can be mitigated by measures such as redistributing \\nrevenue saved, all of which depend on national circumstances (high confidence). Economy-wide policy packages, such \\nas public spending commitments and pricing reforms, can meet short-term economic goals while reducing emissions and \\nshifting development pathways towards sustainability (medium confidence). Effective policy packages would be comprehensive, \\nconsistent, balanced across objectives, and tailored to national circumstances (high confidence). {2.2.2, 4.7}\\nC.6.5 Drawing on diverse knowledges and cultural values, meaningful participation and inclusive engagement processes—\\nincluding Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge—facilitates climate resilient development, \\nbuilds capacity and allows locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions.

Reducing financing barriers for \\nscaling up financial flows would require clear signalling and support by governments, including a stronger alignment \\nof public finances in order to lower real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers and risks and improving \\nthe risk-return profile of investments. At the same time, depending on national contexts, financial actors, including \\ninvestors, financial intermediaries, central banks and financial regulators can shift the systemic underpricing of climate-\\nrelated risks, and reduce sectoral and regional mismatches between available capital and investment needs.  (high \\nconfidence) {4.8.1}\\nC.7.4 Tracked financial flows fall short of the levels needed for adaptation and to achieve mitigation goals across all sectors \\nand regions. These gaps create many opportunities and the challenge of closing gaps is largest in developing countries.  \\nAccelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler \\nto enhance adaptation and mitigation actions and address inequities in access to finance, including its costs, terms \\nand conditions, and economic vulnerability to climate change for developing countries. Scaled-up public grants for \\nmitigation and adaptation funding for vulnerable regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, would be cost-effective and \\nhave high social returns in terms of access to basic energy. Options for scaling up mitigation in developing countries \\ninclude: increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised private finance flows from developed to developing \\ncountries in the context of the USD 100 billion-a-year goal; increased use of public guarantees to reduce risks and \\nleverage private flows at lower cost; local capital markets development; and building greater trust in international \\ncooperation processes. A coordinated effort to make the post-pandemic recovery sustainable over the longer-term \\ncan accelerate climate action, including in developing regions and countries facing high debt costs, debt distress and \\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.

It integrates the main findings of the Sixth \\nAssessment Report (AR6) based on contributions from the three Working Groups1, and the three Special Reports2. The summary \\nfor Policymakers (SPM) is structured in three parts: SPM.A Current Status and Trends, SPM.B Future Climate Change, Risks, and \\nLong-Term Responses, and SPM.C Responses in the Near Term3. \\nThis report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse \\nforms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being \\nand sustainable development, and reflects the increasing diversity of actors involved in climate action. \\nBased on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of \\nconfidence using the IPCC calibrated language4. \\xa0\\n1 The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; AR6 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation \\nand Vulnerability; and AR6 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication \\nrespectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021.\\n2 The three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial \\nlevels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable \\ndevelopment, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land \\ndegradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in \\na Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and \\n15 May 2019.\\n3 In this report, the near term is defined as the period until 2040. The long term is defined as the period beyond 2040.\\n4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. The IPCC calibrated language uses five qualifiers to express a level of \\nconfidence: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms are used to indicate the \\nassessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, \\nabout as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%; and \\nextremely unlikely 0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other \\nAR6 Reports.4\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nA. Current Status and Trends\\nObserved Warming and its Causes\\nA.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally \\ncaused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 \\nin 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal \\nhistorical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and \\nland-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, \\nbetween and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence ). {2.1, Figure 2.1, \\nFigure 2.2}\\nA.1.1 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C 5 higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–1900 6, with larger increases \\nover land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C). Global surface temperature in the first two \\ndecades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature \\nhas increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years ( high confidence). \\n{2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.2  The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–20197 is 0.8°C to \\n1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. Over this period, it is likely that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed \\na warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C 8, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, \\nnatural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability \\nchanged it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.3 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions \\nfrom human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO2 \\nof which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high \\nconfidence). In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2 \\nmillion years (high confidence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per \\nbillion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.4 Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59 ± 6.6 GtCO2-eq9 in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) \\nhigher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990, with the largest share and growth in gross GHG emissions \\noccurring in CO2 from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) followed by methane, whereas the highest \\nrelative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. Average annual GHG emissions \\nduring 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade on record, while the rate of growth between 2010 and \\n2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-1). In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG \\n5 Ranges given throughout the SPM represent very likely ranges (5–95% range) unless otherwise stated.\\n6 The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] °C). Additionally, \\nmethodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the \\nArctic. These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase \\ndoes not represent additional physical warming since AR5.\\n7 The period distinction with A.1.1 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 \\nis 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C.\\n8 Contributions from emissions to the 2010–2019 warming relative to 1850–1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO 2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2]°C; \\nmethane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C. {2.1.1}\\n9 GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different greenhouse gases in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO2-\\nequivalents (CO2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to \\nthe AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and \\nassess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations \\nand uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {2.1.1}5\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nemissions came from the sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together and 22% 10 from agriculture, \\nforestry and other land use (AFOLU). Emissions reductions in CO 2 -FFI due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP \\nand carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, \\nenergy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. ( high confidence) {2.1.1}\\nA.1.5 Historical contributions of CO 2  emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in \\nterms of contributions to CO 2 -FFI and net CO 2  emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO 2 -LULUCF). \\nIn 2019, around 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO 2 -eq per capita 11 (excluding \\nCO 2 -LULUCF) while 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO 2 -eq per capita; of the latter a substantial share lacks \\naccess to modern energy services. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have \\nmuch lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO 2 -eq and 4.6 tCO 2 -eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO 2 -eq), \\nexcluding CO 2 -LULUCF . The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global \\nconsumption-based household GHG emissions, while the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. ( high confidence) { 2.1.1, \\nFigure 2.2}\\nObserved Changes and Impacts\\nA.2 Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have \\noccurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate \\nextremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and \\nrelated losses and damages to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities \\nwho have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately \\naffected (high confidence). {2.1, Table 2.1, Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)\\nA.2.1  It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Global mean sea level increased by \\n0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr -1  between 1901 \\nand 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr -1  between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr -1  \\nbetween 2006 and 2018 ( high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at \\nleast 1971. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical \\ncyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has further strengthened since AR5. Human influence \\nhas likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s, including increases in the frequency of \\nconcurrent heatwaves and droughts ( high confidence).  {2.1.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3, Figure 3.4} ( Figure SPM.1)\\nA.2.2 Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Human and \\necosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high \\nvulnerability to climatic hazards. Increasing weather and climate extreme events have exposed millions of people \\nto acute food insecurity 12 and reduced water security, with the largest adverse impacts observed in many locations \\nand/or communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, Small Islands and the Arctic, and globally for \\nIndigenous Peoples, small-scale food producers and low-income households. Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality \\nfrom floods, droughts and storms was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low \\nvulnerability. ( high confidence)  {2.1.2, 4.4} ( Figure SPM.1)\\nA.2.3 Climate change has caused substantial damages, and increasingly irreversible losses, in terrestrial, freshwater, \\ncryospheric, and coastal and open ocean ecosystems ( high confidence). Hundreds of local losses of species have been \\ndriven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes  ( high confidence ) with mass mortality events recorded on \\nland and in the ocean ( very high confidence ). Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as \\nthe impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain ( medium \\nconfidence) and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw ( high confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} ( Figure SPM.1)\\n10 GHG emission levels are rounded to two significant digits; as a consequence, small differences in sums due to rounding may occur. {2.1.1}\\n11 Territorial emissions.\\n12 Acute food insecurity can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result \\nof shocks risking determinants of food security and nutrition, and is used to assess the need for humanitarian action. {2.1}6\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nA.2.4 Climate change has reduced food security and affected water security, hindering efforts to meet Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals ( high confidence). Although overall agricultural productivity has increased, climate change has \\nslowed this growth over the past 50 years globally ( medium confidence), with related negative impacts mainly in mid- \\nand low latitude regions but positive impacts in some high latitude regions ( high confidence). Ocean warming and \\nocean acidification have adversely affected food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture in some oceanic \\nregions  (high confidence). Roughly half of the world’s population currently experience severe water scarcity for at least \\npart of the year due to a combination of climatic and non-climatic drivers ( medium confidence). { 2.1.2, Figure 2.3 } \\n( Figure SPM.1)\\nA.2.5 In all regions increases in extreme heat events have resulted in human mortality and morbidity ( very high confidence). \\nThe occurrence of climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases ( very high confidence ) and the incidence \\nof vector-borne diseases ( high confidence) have increased. In assessed regions, some mental health challenges are \\nassociated with increasing temperatures ( high confidence), trauma from extreme events ( very high confidence ), and \\nloss of livelihoods and culture ( high confidence). Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement \\nin Africa, Asia, North America ( high confidence), and Central and South America ( medium confidence), with small island \\nstates in the Caribbean and South Pacific being disproportionately affected relative to their small population size ( high \\nconfidence). { 2.1.2, Figure 2.3} ( Figure SPM.1) \\nA.2.6  Climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages 13 to nature and people that are \\nunequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors. Economic damages from climate change have been detected \\nin climate-exposed sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, and tourism. Individual livelihoods have been \\naffected through, for example, destruction of homes and infrastructure, and loss of property and income, human health \\nand food security, with adverse effects on gender and social equity.  ( high confidence) {2.1.2} ( Figure SPM.1)\\nA.2.7 In urban areas, observed climate change has caused adverse impacts on human health, livelihoods and key infrastructure. \\nHot extremes have intensified in cities. Urban infrastructure, including transportation, water, sanitation and energy \\nsystems have been compromised by extreme and slow-onset events 14, with resulting economic losses, disruptions of \\nservices and negative impacts to well-being. Observed adverse impacts are concentrated amongst economically and \\nsocially marginalised urban residents. ( high confidence) {2.1.2}\\n13 In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic (see \\nAnnex I: Glossary).\\n14 Slow-onset events are described among the climatic-impact drivers of the AR6 WGI and refer to the risks and impacts associated with e.g., increasing \\ntemperature means, desertification, decreasing precipitation, loss of biodiversity, land and forest degradation, glacial retreat and related impacts, ocean \\nacidification, sea level rise and salinization. {2.1.2}7\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nFigure SPM.1: (a) Climate change has already caused widespread impacts and related losses and damages on human systems and altered terrestrial, \\nfreshwater and ocean ecosystems worldwide.

Future projections (2021–2100) of changes in global surface temperature are shown for very low \\n(SSP1-1.9), low (SSP1-2.6), intermediate (SSP2-4.5), high (SSP3-7.0) and very high (SSP5-8.5) GHG emissions scenarios. Changes in annual global surface \\ntemperatures are presented as ‘climate stripes’, with future projections showing the human-caused long-term trends and continuing modulation by natural \\nvariability (represented here using observed levels of past natural variability).

Despite progress, adaptation gaps \\nexist, and will continue to grow at current rates of implementation. Hard and soft limits to \\nadaptation have been reached in some ecosystems and regions. Maladaptation is happening \\nin some sectors and regions. Current global financial flows for adaptation are insufficient \\nfor, and constrain implementation of, adaptation options, especially in developing countries \\n(high confidence). {2.2, 2.3}\\nA.3.1 Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been observed across all sectors and regions, generating \\nmultiple benefits  (very high confidence ). Growing public and political awareness of climate impacts and risks has \\nresulted in at least 170 countries and many cities including adaptation in their climate policies and planning processes \\n(high confidence). {2.2.3}\\nA.3.2 Effectiveness 15  of adaptation in reducing climate risks 16  is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions ( high \\nconfidence). Examples of effective adaptation options include: cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and \\nstorage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape level \\ndiversification in agriculture, sustainable land management approaches, use of agroecological principles and practices \\nand other approaches that work with natural processes  (high confidence). Ecosystem-based adaptation17  approaches \\nsuch as urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems have been effective in reducing \\nflood risks and urban heat (high confidence). Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and \\nstructural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives in case of inland flooding  (medium confidence). Adaptation \\noptions such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and social safety nets have broad \\napplicability across multiple sectors (high confidence). {2.2.3}\\nA.3.3 Most observed adaptation responses are fragmented, incremental 18 , sector-specific and unequally distributed across \\nregions. Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist across sectors and regions, and will continue to grow under current \\nlevels of implementation, with the largest adaptation gaps among lower income groups. (high confidence) {2.3.2}\\nA.3.4 There is increased evidence of maladaptation in various sectors and regions. Maladaptation especially affects \\nmarginalised and vulnerable groups adversely. (high confidence) {2.3.2}\\nA.3.5 Soft limits to adaptation are currently being experienced by small-scale farmers and households along some low-\\nlying coastal areas ( medium confidence ) resulting from financial, governance, institutional and policy constraints \\n(high confidence). Some tropical, coastal, polar and mountain ecosystems have reached hard adaptation limits  (high \\nconfidence). Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching \\nsoft and hard limits (high confidence). {2.3.2}\\n15  Effectiveness refers here to the extent to which an adaptation option is anticipated or observed to reduce climate-related risk.  {2.2.3}\\n16  See Annex I: Glossary. { 2.2.3}\\n17  Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) is recognized internationally under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD14/5). A related concept is Nature-based \\nSolutions (NbS), see Annex I: Glossary.\\n18  Incremental adaptations to change in climate are understood as extensions of actions and behaviours that already reduce the losses or enhance the \\nbenefits of natural variations in extreme weather/climate events.  {2.3.2}9\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nA.3.6 Key barriers to adaptation are limited resources, lack of private sector and citizen engagement, insufficient mobilization \\nof finance (including for research), low climate literacy, lack of political commitment, limited research and/or slow and \\nlow uptake of adaptation science, and low sense of urgency. There are widening disparities between the estimated costs \\nof adaptation and the finance allocated to adaptation  ( high confidence). Adaptation finance has come predominantly \\nfrom public sources, and a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to adaptation and an \\noverwhelming majority to mitigation  ( very high confidence ). Although global tracked climate finance has shown \\nan upward trend since AR5, current global financial flows for adaptation, including from public and private finance \\nsources, are insufficient and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries ( high \\nconfidence).  Adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages \\nand through impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation, \\nparticularly for developing and least developed countries ( medium confidence) . {2.3.2, 2.3.3}\\nBox SPM.1 The use of scenarios and modelled pathways in the AR6 Synthesis Report\\nModelled scenarios and pathways 19 are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and risks, and \\npossible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables \\nand mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission \\npathways, including those based on cost effective approaches contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, \\nand have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about \\nglobal equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions \\nunderlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures. 20 {Cross-Section Box.2}\\nWGI assessed the climate response to five illustrative scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) 21 that \\ncover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. High and \\nvery high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 22) have CO 2  emissions that roughly double from current levels \\nby 2100 and 2050, respectively. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO 2  emissions remaining around \\ncurrent levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have \\nCO 2  emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO 2  \\nemissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 23 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate \\nchanges, impacts and risks. In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 \\npathways were categorised based on their assessed global warming over the 21st century; categories range from pathways \\nthat limit warming to 1.5°C with more than 50% likelihood (noted >50% in this report) with no or limited overshoot (C1) to \\npathways that exceed 4°C (C8).  {Cross-Section Box.2} ( Box SPM.1, Table 1)\\nGlobal warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850–1900 are used to integrate the assessment of climate change and related \\nimpacts and risks since patterns of changes for many variables at a given GWL are common to all scenarios considered and \\nindependent of timing when that level is reached. { Cross-Section Box.2}\\n19 In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI \\nprimarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emission and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when \\nreferring to WGI and modelled emission and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.\\n20 Around half of all modelled global emission pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The \\nother half looks at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.\\n21 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the \\nscenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. {Cross-Section Box.2}\\n22 Very high emissions scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out. Warming levels >4°C may result from very high emissions scenarios, but can \\nalso occur from lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. {3.1.1}\\n23 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m -2) resulting from the \\nscenario in the year 2100. The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not \\nidentical, with differences in concentration trajectories.

There are gaps between projected emissions from implemented \\npolicies and those from NDCs and finance flows fall short of the levels needed to meet climate \\ngoals across all sectors and regions. (high confidence) {2.2, 2.3, Figure 2.5, Table 2.2}\\nA.4.1 The UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement are supporting rising levels of national ambition. The Paris Agreement, \\nadopted under the UNFCCC, with near universal participation, has led to policy development and target-setting at national \\nand sub-national levels, in particular in relation to mitigation, as well as enhanced transparency of climate action and \\nsupport (medium confidence). Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully \\n(high confidence). In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and \\naccelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions ( high \\nconfidence). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to several 24 Gt CO2-eq yr-1 of avoided \\nglobal emissions ( medium confidence ). At least 18 countries have sustained absolute production-based GHG and \\nconsumption-based CO2 reductions25 for longer than 10 years. These reductions have only partly offset global emissions \\ngrowth (high confidence). {2.2.1, 2.2.2}\\nA.4.2 Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, \\nenergy efficiency, demand-side management, improved forest and crop/grassland management, and reduced food \\nwaste and loss, are technically viable, are becoming increasingly cost effective and are generally supported by the \\n24 At least 1.8 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 can be accounted for by aggregating separate estimates for the effects of economic and regulatory instruments.

From 2010 to 2019 there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy (85%), wind energy \\n(55%), and lithium-ion batteries (85%), and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for \\nelectric vehicles (EVs), varying widely across regions. The mix of policy instruments that reduced costs and stimulated \\nadoption includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as \\ndeployment subsidies to attain scale. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be \\nmore expensive than transitioning to low emission systems. ( high confidence) {2.2.2, Figure 2.4}\\nA.4.3  A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists between global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of \\nNDCs announced prior to COP26 26 and those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C \\n(>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2°C (>67%) assuming immediate action ( high confidence). This \\nwould make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century ( high confidence). Global modelled mitigation \\npathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2°C (>67%) assuming \\nimmediate action imply deep global GHG emissions reductions this decade ( high confidence) (see SPM Box 1, Table 1, B.6) 27. \\nModelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in \\nambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4] °C by 2100  ( medium \\nconfidence) . Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO 2  by around mid-century \\nbut pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver \\non them. { 2.3.1, Table 2.2, Figure 2.5, Table 3.1, 4.1}\\nA.4.4 Policy coverage is uneven across sectors ( high confidence). Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to \\nresult in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than emissions implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap’ \\n( high confidence). Without a strengthening of policies, global warming of 3.2 [2.2 to 3.5] °C is projected by 2100 \\n( medium confidence).  {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 3.1.1, Figure 2.5} ( Box SPM.1, Figure SPM.5)\\nA.4.5  The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due \\nin part to limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity ( medium confidence ).

The overwhelming majority of tracked climate finance is directed towards mitigation, \\nbut nevertheless falls short of the levels needed to limit warming to below 2°C or to 1.5°C across all sectors and \\nregions (see C7.2) ( very high confidence ). In 2018, public and publicly mobilised private climate finance flows from \\ndeveloped to developing countries were below the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to mobilise \\nUSD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation \\n( medium confidence) . {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.3}\\n26 Due to the literature cutoff date of WGIII, the additional NDCs submitted after 11 October 2021 are not assessed here. {Footnote 32 in the Longer Report}\\n27 Projected 2030 GHG emissions are 50 (47–55) GtCO2-eq if all conditional NDC elements are taken into account.

Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would \\nlead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades, and also \\nto discernible changes in atmospheric composition within a few years  (high confidence ). \\n{Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.1, 4.3 } (Figure SPM.2, Box SPM.1)\\nB.1.1 Global warming 28 will continue to increase in the near term (2021–2040) mainly due to increased cumulative \\nCO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more \\nlikely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) and likely or very likely to \\nexceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates \\nof the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term 29. Global warming declines back \\nto below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed \\nclimate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range \\nfrom 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario \\n(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for \\ncorresponding scenarios in AR5. {Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)\\nB.1.2 Discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature between contrasting GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 \\nand SSP1-2.6 vs. SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) would begin to emerge from natural variability32 within around 20 years. Under \\nthese contrasting scenarios, discernible effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for air \\nquality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution controls and strong and sustained methane emissions \\nreductions.  Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years \\ncompared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios \\nthat combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions33. (high confidence) {3.1.1} (Box SPM.1)\\nB.1.3 Continued emissions will further affect all major climate system components.

Global surface \\ntemperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-caused trend, due to natural variability. The internal variability of global \\nsurface temperature in a single year is estimated to be about ±0.25°C (5–95% range, high confidence). The occurrence of individual years with global \\nsurface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. {4.3, Cross-Section Box.2}\\n29 Median five-year interval at which a 1.5°C global warming level is reached (50% probability) in categories of modelled pathways considered in WGIII is \\n2030–2035. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and \\n60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI (medium confidence). In all scenarios considered in WGI except the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), \\nthe midpoint of the first 20-year running average period during which the assessed average global surface temperature change reaches 1.5°C lies in the \\nfirst half of the 2030s. In the very high GHG emissions scenario, the midpoint is in the late 2020s. {3.1.1, 3.3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)\\n30 The best estimates [and very likely ranges] for the different scenarios are: 1.4 [1.0 to 1.8 ]°C (SSP1-1.9); 1.8 [1.3 to 2.4]°C (SSP1-2.6); 2.7 [2.1 to 3.5]°C \\n(SSP2-4.5); 3.6 [2.8 to 4.6]°C (SSP3-7.0); and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7 ]°C (SSP5-8.5). {3.1.1} (Box SPM.1)\\n31 Assessed future changes in global surface temperature have been constructed, for the first time, by combining multi-model projections with observational \\nconstraints and the assessed equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response.

The burning embers result from a literature \\nbased expert elicitation. Panel (a): Left – Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 \\nmodel simulations with observational constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity. Very \\nlikely ranges are shown for the low and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0) (Cross-Section Box.2). Right – Global Reasons for Concern \\n(RFC), comparing AR6 (thick embers) and AR5 (thin embers) assessments. Risk transitions have generally shifted towards lower temperatures with updated \\nscientific understanding. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming low to no adaptation. Lines connect the midpoints of the transitions from moderate to high \\nrisk across AR5 and AR6. Panel (b): Selected global risks for land and ocean ecosystems, illustrating general increase of risk with global warming levels with low \\nto no adaptation. Panel (c): Left - Global mean sea level change in centimetres, relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges \\nbefore 1992 and altimeters afterwards. The future changes to 2100 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based \\non emulation of CMIP , ice-sheet, and glacier models, and likely ranges are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0.  Right - Assessment of the combined risk of coastal \\nflooding, erosion and salinization for four illustrative coastal geographies in 2100, due to changing mean and extreme sea levels, under two response scenarios, \\nwith respect to the SROCC baseline period (1986–2005). The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by \\nmean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). “No-to-moderate \\nresponse” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further significant action or new types of actions). “Maximum potential response” represent a combination of \\nresponses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and political barriers. \\n(In this context, ‘today’ refers to 2019.) The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability, coastal hazards, in-situ responses and planned relocation. \\nPlanned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlements. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, \\nmay or may not be considered to be adaptation. Panel (d): Selected risks under different socio-economic pathways, illustrating how development strategies \\nand challenges to adaptation influence risk. Left - Heat-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The diagrams are \\ntruncated at the nearest whole ºC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP scenarios. Right - Risks associated with food security due to \\nclimate change and patterns of socio-economic development. Risks to food security include availability and access to food, including population at risk of hunger, \\nfood price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable to childhood underweight. Risks are assessed for two contrasted socio-economic \\npathways (SSP1 and SSP3) excluding the effects of targeted mitigation and adaptation policies.  {Figure 3.3} ( Box SPM.1)\\nLikelihood and Risks of Unavoidable, Irreversible or Abrupt \\nChanges\\nB.3 Some future changes are unavoidable and/or irreversible but can be limited by deep, rapid, \\nand sustained global greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The likelihood of abrupt and/or \\nirreversible changes increases with higher global warming levels. Similarly, the probability \\nof low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large adverse impacts increases \\nwith higher global warming levels. (high confidence) {3.1}\\nB.3.1 Limiting global surface temperature does not prevent continued changes in climate system components that have \\nmulti-decadal or longer timescales of response (high confidence). Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia \\ndue to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years \\n(high confidence). However, deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions would limit further sea level rise \\nacceleration and projected long-term sea level rise commitment. Relative to 1995–2014, the likely global mean sea \\nlevel rise under the SSP1-1.9 GHG emissions scenario is 0.15–0.23 m by 2050 and 0.28–0.55 m by 2100; while for the \\nSSP5-8.5 GHG emissions scenario it is 0.20–0.29 m by 2050 and 0.63–1.01 m by 2100 ( medium confidence). Over the \\nnext 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2–3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2–6 m if limited to \\n2°C (low confidence). {3.1.3, Figure 3.4} (Box SPM.1)\\nB.3.2 The likelihood and impacts of abrupt and/or irreversible changes in the climate system, including changes triggered \\nwhen tipping points are reached, increase with further global warming (high confidence). As warming levels increase, so \\ndo the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems including forests (medium confidence), \\ncoral reefs (very high confidence) and in Arctic regions (high confidence). At sustained warming levels between 2°C and \\n3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia, \\ncausing several metres of sea level rise (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher \\nglobal surface temperatures (high confidence). {3.1.2, 3.1.3}\\nB.3.3 The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global \\nwarming levels ( high confidence). Due to deep uncertainty linked to ice-sheet processes, global mean sea level rise \\nabove the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under the very high GHG emissions \\nscenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) – cannot be excluded. There is medium confidence that the Atlantic Meridional \\nOverturning Circulation will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt \\nshifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities. {3.1.3} (Box SPM.1)19\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nAdaptation Options and their Limits in a Warmer World\\nB.4 Adaptation options that are feasible and effective today will become constrained and \\nless effective with increasing global warming. With increasing global warming, losses and \\ndamages will increase and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation \\nlimits. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term \\nplanning and implementation of adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and \\nsystems. (high confidence) {3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 }\\nB.4.1 The effectiveness of adaptation, including ecosystem-based and most water-related options, will decrease with \\nincreasing warming. The feasibility and effectiveness of options increase with integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that \\ndifferentiate responses based on climate risk, cut across systems and address social inequities. As adaptation options \\noften have long implementation times, long-term planning increases their efficiency. (high confidence) {3.2, Figure 3.4, \\n4.1, 4.2} \\nB.4.2 With additional global warming, limits to adaptation and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among vulnerable \\npopulations, will become increasingly difficult to avoid ( high confidence ). Above 1.5°C of global warming, limited \\nfreshwater resources pose potential hard adaptation limits for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier \\nand snow melt ( medium confidence ). Above that level, ecosystems such as some warm-water coral reefs, coastal \\nwetlands, rainforests, and polar and mountain ecosystems will have reached or surpassed hard adaptation limits and as \\na consequence, some Ecosystem-based Adaptation measures will also lose their effectiveness (high confidence). {2.3.2, \\n3.2, 4.3}\\nB.4.3 Actions that focus on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation over the long \\nterm, creating lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult to change. For example, seawalls effectively \\nreduce impacts to people and assets in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate \\nrisks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan. Maladaptive responses can worsen \\nexisting inequities especially for Indigenous Peoples and marginalised groups and decrease ecosystem and biodiversity \\nresilience. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term planning and implementation \\nof adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and systems. (high confidence) {2.3.2, 3.2}\\nCarbon Budgets and Net Zero Emissions\\nB.5 Limiting human-caused global warming requires net zero CO 2 emissions. Cumulative carbon \\nemissions until the time of reaching net zero CO 2 emissions and the level of greenhouse \\ngas emission reductions this decade largely determine whether warming can be limited to \\n1.5°C or 2°C (high confidence). Projected CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure \\nwithout additional abatement would exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%) \\n(high confidence). {2.3, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1}\\nB.5.1 From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative \\nCO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. \\nReaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO 2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and \\nimplies net negative CO 2 emissions39. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to achieve net negative CO 2 \\nemissions (see B.6). Net zero GHG emissions, if sustained, are projected to result in a gradual decline in global surface \\ntemperatures after an earlier peak. (high confidence) {3.1.1, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, Table 3.1, Cross-Section Box.1}\\nB.5.2 For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global surface temperature rises by 0.45°C (best estimate, with a likely \\nrange from 0.27°C to 0.63°C). The best estimates of the remaining carbon budgets from the beginning of 2020 are \\n500 GtCO2 for a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 1150 GtCO 2 for a 67% likelihood of limiting \\nwarming to 2°C40. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions, the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given \\nremaining carbon budget or the larger remaining carbon budget for the same level of temperature change41. {3.3.1}\\n39 Net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential. See footnote 9.\\n40 Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Most countries report their \\nanthropogenic land CO2 fluxes including fluxes due to human-caused environmental change (e.g., CO 2 fertilisation) on ‘managed’ land in their national \\nGHG inventories. Using emissions estimates based on these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced. {3.3.1}\\n41 For example, remaining carbon budgets could be 300 or 600 GtCO 2 for 1.5°C (50%), respectively for high and low non-CO 2 emissions, compared to \\n500 GtCO2 in the central case.  {3.3.1}20\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nB.5.3 If the annual CO 2  emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative \\nemissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%), and deplete more than a third of the \\nremaining carbon budget for 2°C (67%). Estimates of future CO 2  emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructures \\nwithout additional abatement 42 already exceed the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5°C (50%) \\n( high confidence ). Projected cumulative future CO 2  emissions over the lifetime of existing and planned fossil fuel \\ninfrastructure, if historical operating patterns are maintained and without additional abatement 43, are approximately \\nequal to the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83% 44 ( high confidence). { 2.3.1, \\n3.3.1, Figure 3.5}\\nB.5.4  Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO 2  emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about \\nfour fifths 45 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (central estimate about \\n2900 GtCO 2 ), and to about two thirds 46 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C \\n(central estimate about 3550 GtCO 2 ). { 3.3.1, Figure 3.5}\\nMitigation Pathways\\nB.6  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, \\nand those that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), involve rapid and deep and, in most cases, \\nimmediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade. Global net zero CO2 \\nemissions are reached for these pathway categories, in the early 2050s and around the early \\n2070s, respectively. (high confidence) {3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.5, Table 3.1} (Figure SPM.5, Box SPM.1)\\nB.6.1  Global modelled pathways provide information on limiting warming to different levels; these pathways, particularly \\ntheir sectoral and regional aspects, depend on the assumptions described in Box SPM.1. Global modelled pathways that \\nlimit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2°C (>67%) are characterized by deep, \\nrapid, and, in most cases, immediate GHG emissions reductions. Pathways that limit warming to 1.5 °C (>50%) with no \\nor limited overshoot reach net zero CO 2  in the early 2050s, followed by net negative CO 2  emissions. Those pathways that \\nreach net zero GHG emissions do so around the 2070s. Pathways that limit warming to 2 °C (>67%) reach net zero CO 2  \\nemissions in the early 2070s. Global GHG emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025 \\nin global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit \\nwarming to 2°C (>67%) and assume immediate action.

For example, in modelled pathways that \\nlimit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, global methane emissions are reduced by 34 [21–57] % \\nby 2030 relative to 2019. However, some hard-to-abate residual GHG emissions (e.g., some emissions from agriculture, \\naviation, shipping, and industrial processes) remain and would need to be counterbalanced by deployment of CDR \\nmethods to achieve net zero CO2 or GHG emissions (high confidence). As a result, net zero CO2 is reached earlier than \\nnet zero GHGs (high confidence). {3.3.2, 3.3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.5} (Figure SPM.5)\\nB.6.3 Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels \\nwithout carbon capture and storage (CCS) to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels \\nwith CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR47 . In most global \\nmodelled pathways, land-use change and forestry (via reforestation and reduced deforestation) and the energy supply \\nsector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. (high confidence) {3.3.3, \\n4.1, 4.5, Figure 4.1} (Figure SPM.5, Box SPM.1)\\nB.6.4 Mitigation options often have synergies with other aspects of sustainable development, but some options can also \\nhave trade-offs. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency \\nand renewable energy. Similarly, depending on the context 48 , biological CDR methods like reforestation, improved \\nforest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management can enhance \\nbiodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods. However, afforestation or production of \\nbiomass crops can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water \\nsecurity, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land \\ntenure is insecure. Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently or that shift global development \\ntowards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as less dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity. \\n(high confidence) {3.4.1}\\n47  CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available. When CO 2  is \\ncaptured directly from the atmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO 2  capture and \\nsubsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the \\npower sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated \\nto be on the order of 1000 GtCO 2 , which is more than the CO 2  storage requirements through 2100 to limit global warming to 1.5°C, although the regional \\navailability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the CO 2  \\ncan be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental \\nand socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C to 2°C. \\nEnabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support and technological innovation could reduce these barriers.

Adverse \\nimpacts that occur during this period of overshoot and cause additional warming via feedback mechanisms, such as \\nincreased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, and permafrost thawing, weakening natural land \\ncarbon sinks and increasing releases of GHGs would make the return more challenging ( medium confidence). {3.3.2, \\n3.3.4, Table 3.1, Figure 3.6} (Box SPM.1)\\nB.7.2 The higher the magnitude and the longer the duration of overshoot, the more ecosystems and societies are exposed \\nto greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, increasing risks for many natural and human \\nsystems.

Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and \\ngeophysical) were used to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For \\npotential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and \\nlow. The right-hand side of Panel a provides an overview of selected mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Costs are net lifetime \\ndiscounted monetary costs of avoided GHG emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and \\ntime and in the longer term compared to 2030. The potential (horizontal axis) is the net GHG emission reduction (sum of reduced emissions and/or enhanced \\nsinks) broken down into cost categories (coloured bar segments) relative to an emission baseline consisting of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios \\nfrom the AR6 scenarios database. The potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not additive. Health system mitigation options are included \\nmostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching \\nto electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. Gradual colour transitions indicate uncertain breakdown into cost categories due to uncertainty or heavy \\ncontext dependency. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options \\nfor 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the \\nsectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. \\nThe green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest \\nand the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use \\npatterns enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use \\nsectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional \\nenergy and resources. The last row shows how demand-side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows \\nthe projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, \\nthis projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural \\nfactors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow).  {Figure 4.4} \\nMitigation and Adaptation Options across Systems \\nC.3\\t Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve \\ndeep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. \\nThese system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and \\nadaptation options.

Large contributions \\nto emissions reductions with costs less than USD 20 tCO 2-eq-1 come from solar and wind energy, energy efficiency \\nimprovements, and methane emissions reductions (coal mining, oil and gas, waste) ( medium confidence).

Trade-offs can be evaluated and minimised by \\ngiving emphasis to capacity building, finance, governance, technology transfer, investments, development, context \\nspecific gender-based and other social equity considerations with meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples, local \\ncommunities and vulnerable populations.

For example, improved access to clean energy sources and technologies \\ngenerates health benefits especially for women and children; electrification combined with low-GHG energy, and shifts \\nto active mobility and public transport can enhance air quality, health, employment, and can elicit energy security and \\ndeliver equity.

Integrating climate adaptation into social protection \\nprograms improves resilience. Many options are available for reducing emission-intensive \\nconsumption, including through behavioural and lifestyle changes, with co-benefits for \\nsocietal well-being. (high confidence) {4.4, 4.5}\\nC.5.1 Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts in differentiation between states \\nover time and challenges in assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive \\nchanges in economic structure, with significant distributional consequences, within and between countries. Distributional \\nconsequences within and between countries include shifting of income and employment during the transition from \\nhigh- to low-emissions activities. ( high confidence)  {4.4}\\nC.5.2 Adaptation and mitigation actions that prioritise equity, social justice, climate justice, rights-based approaches, and \\ninclusivity, lead to more sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate \\nresilient development. Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable, social \\nsafety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-\\noffs with sustainable development goals. Attention to equity and broad and meaningful participation of all relevant \\nactors in decision making at all scales can build social trust which builds on equitable sharing of benefits and burdens \\nof mitigation that deepen and widen support for transformative changes.  ( high confidence)  {4.4}\\nC.5.3 Regions and people (3.3 to 3.6 billion in number) with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to \\nclimatic hazards (see A.2.2). Adaptation outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries and regions are \\nenhanced through approaches focusing on equity, inclusivity and rights-based approaches. Vulnerability is exacerbated \\nby inequity and marginalisation linked to e.g., gender, ethnicity, low incomes, informal settlements, disability, age, \\nand historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local \\ncommunities. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works \\nprograms, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services \\nand infrastructure. The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising access to finance to \\nreduce climate risk for low-income and marginalised communities including people living in informal settlements. ( high \\nconfidence)  {4.4, 4.5.3, 4.5.5, 4.5.6}\\nC.5.4  The design of regulatory instruments and economic instruments and consumption-based approaches, can advance equity. \\nIndividuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, and have the highest potential \\nfor emissions reductions. Many options are available for reducing emission-intensive consumption while improving \\nsocietal well-being. Socio-cultural options, behaviour and lifestyle changes supported by policies, infrastructure, and \\ntechnology can help end-users shift to low-emissions-intensive consumption, with multiple co-benefits.  A substantial \\nshare of the population in low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services. Technology development, \\ntransfer, capacity building and financing can support developing countries / regions leapfrogging or transitioning to \\nlow-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-benefits. Climate resilient development is advanced \\nwhen actors work in equitable, just and inclusive ways to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, toward \\nequitable and just outcomes. ( high confidence)  {2.1, 4.4}32\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nGovernance and Policies  \\nC.6 Effective climate action is enabled by political commitment, well-aligned multilevel \\ngovernance, institutional frameworks, laws, policies and strategies and enhanced access \\nto finance and technology. Clear goals, coordination across multiple policy domains, and \\ninclusive governance processes facilitate effective climate action. Regulatory and economic \\ninstruments can support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience if scaled up and \\napplied widely. Climate resilient development benefits from drawing on diverse knowledge. \\n(high confidence) {2.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7}\\nC.6.1 Effective climate governance enables mitigation and adaptation. Effective governance provides overall direction on \\nsetting targets and priorities and mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national \\ncircumstances and in the context of international cooperation. It enhances monitoring and evaluation and regulatory \\ncertainty, prioritising inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, and improves access to finance and \\ntechnology (see C.7). (high confidence) {2.2.2, 4.7}\\nC.6.2 Effective local, municipal, national and subnational institutions build consensus for climate action among diverse \\ninterests, enable coordination and inform strategy setting but require adequate institutional capacity. Policy support is \\ninfluenced by actors in civil society, including businesses, youth, women, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local \\ncommunities. Effectiveness is enhanced by political commitment and partnerships between different groups in society. \\n(high confidence) {2.2, 4.7}\\nC.6.3 Effective multilevel governence for mitigation, adaptation, risk management, and climate resilient development is \\nenabled by inclusive decision processes that prioritise equity and justice in planning and implementation, allocation of \\nappropriate resources, institutional review, and monitoring and evaluation. Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often \\nreduced through carefully designed and implemented laws, policies, participatory processes, and interventions that \\naddress context specific inequities such as those based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income. (high \\nconfidence) {4.4, 4.7}\\nC.6.4  Regulatory and economic instruments could support deep emissions reductions if scaled up and applied more widely \\n(high confidence). Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments can improve mitigation outcomes in \\nsectoral applications, consistent with national circumstances ( high confidence). Where implemented, carbon pricing \\ninstruments have incentivized low-cost emissions reduction measures but have been less effective, on their own and \\nat prevailing prices during the assessment period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary for further reductions \\n(medium confidence ). Equity and distributional impacts of such carbon pricing instruments, e.g., carbon taxes and \\nemissions trading, can be addressed by using revenue to support low-income households, among other approaches. \\nRemoving fossil fuel subsidies would reduce emissions 54 and yield benefits such as improved public revenue, \\nmacroeconomic and sustainability performance; subsidy removal can have adverse distributional impacts, especially \\non the most economically vulnerable groups which, in some cases can be mitigated by measures such as redistributing \\nrevenue saved, all of which depend on national circumstances (high confidence). Economy-wide policy packages, such \\nas public spending commitments and pricing reforms, can meet short-term economic goals while reducing emissions and \\nshifting development pathways towards sustainability (medium confidence). Effective policy packages would be comprehensive, \\nconsistent, balanced across objectives, and tailored to national circumstances (high confidence). {2.2.2, 4.7}\\nC.6.5 Drawing on diverse knowledges and cultural values, meaningful participation and inclusive engagement processes—\\nincluding Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge—facilitates climate resilient development, \\nbuilds capacity and allows locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions. (high confidence) {4.4, 4.5.6, 4.7}\\n54 Fossil fuel subsidy removal is projected by various studies to reduce global CO2 emission by 1 to 4%, and GHG emissions by up to 10% by 2030, varying \\nacross regions (medium confidence).33\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nSummary for Policymakers\\nFinance, Technology and International Cooperation\\nC.7 Finance, technology and international cooperation are critical enablers for accelerated climate \\naction. If climate goals are to be achieved, both adaptation and mitigation financing would \\nneed to increase many-fold. There is sufficient global capital to close the global investment \\ngaps but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action. Enhancing technology \\ninnovation systems is key to accelerate the widespread adoption of technologies and \\npractices. Enhancing international cooperation is possible through multiple channels. ( high \\nconfidence) {2.3, 4.8}\\nC.7.1 Improved availability of and access to finance 55 would enable accelerated climate action ( very high confidence ). \\nAddressing needs and gaps and broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, when combined \\nwith other supportive actions, can act as a catalyst for accelerating adaptation and mitigation, and enabling climate \\nresilient development (high confidence). If climate goals are to be achieved, and to address rising risks and accelerate \\ninvestments in emissions reductions, both adaptation and mitigation finance would need to increase many-fold  (high \\nconfidence). {4.8.1}\\nC.7.2 Increased access to finance can build capacity and address soft limits to adaptation and avert rising risks, especially for \\ndeveloping countries, vulnerable groups, regions and sectors (high confidence). Public finance is an important enabler \\nof adaptation and mitigation, and can also leverage private finance  (high confidence ). Average annual modelled \\nmitigation investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of \\nthree to six greater than current levels56, and total mitigation investments (public, private, domestic and international) \\nwould need to increase across all sectors and regions (medium confidence). Even if extensive global mitigation efforts \\nare implemented, there will be a need for financial, technical, and human resources for adaptation ( high confidence). \\n{4.3, 4.8.1}\\nC.7.3 There is sufficient global capital and liquidity to close global investment gaps, given the size of the global financial \\nsystem, but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action both within and outside the global financial sector and \\nin the context of economic vulnerabilities and indebtedness facing developing countries. Reducing financing barriers for \\nscaling up financial flows would require clear signalling and support by governments, including a stronger alignment \\nof public finances in order to lower real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers and risks and improving \\nthe risk-return profile of investments. At the same time, depending on national contexts, financial actors, including \\ninvestors, financial intermediaries, central banks and financial regulators can shift the systemic underpricing of climate-\\nrelated risks, and reduce sectoral and regional mismatches between available capital and investment needs.  (high \\nconfidence) {4.8.1}\\nC.7.4 Tracked financial flows fall short of the levels needed for adaptation and to achieve mitigation goals across all sectors \\nand regions. These gaps create many opportunities and the challenge of closing gaps is largest in developing countries.  \\nAccelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler \\nto enhance adaptation and mitigation actions and address inequities in access to finance, including its costs, terms \\nand conditions, and economic vulnerability to climate change for developing countries. Scaled-up public grants for \\nmitigation and adaptation funding for vulnerable regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, would be cost-effective and \\nhave high social returns in terms of access to basic energy. Options for scaling up mitigation in developing countries \\ninclude: increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised private finance flows from developed to developing \\ncountries in the context of the USD 100 billion-a-year goal; increased use of public guarantees to reduce risks and \\nleverage private flows at lower cost; local capital markets development; and building greater trust in international \\ncooperation processes. A coordinated effort to make the post-pandemic recovery sustainable over the longer-term \\ncan accelerate climate action, including in developing regions and countries facing high debt costs, debt distress and \\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.

( high \\nconfidence)  {4.8.3}\\nC.7.6 International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving ambitious climate change mitigation, adaptation, and climate \\nresilient development ( high confidence). Climate resilient development is enabled by increased international cooperation \\nincluding mobilising and enhancing access to finance, particularly for developing countries, vulnerable regions, sectors \\nand groups and aligning finance flows for climate action to be consistent with ambition levels and funding needs ( high \\nconfidence). Enhancing international cooperation on finance, technology and capacity building can enable greater \\nambition and can act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and adaptation, and shifting development pathways \\ntowards sustainability  ( high confidence). This includes support to NDCs and accelerating technology development and \\ndeployment  ( high confidence ). Transnational partnerships can stimulate policy development, technology diffusion, \\nadaptation and mitigation, though uncertainties remain over their costs, feasibility and effectiveness ( medium \\nconfidence).
